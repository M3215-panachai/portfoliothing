            <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Panachai Paweenwongwan</strong>, and I am from Chonburi, a beautiful province in Thailand. I'm currently a student attending <strong>Chonradsadornumrung School</strong> in the English Program. I previously studied at the <strong>International Education Program (IEP)</strong> for my elementary years.</p>

            <p>I consider myself to be a friendly person once you get to know me, but I sometimes find it difficult to talk to new people. Despite that, I love connecting with those around me and always strive to bring a positive vibe into my interactions.</p>

            <p>One of my main hobbies is reading, as it helps me relax and expand my knowledge. When I'm not reading, I enjoy playing games, with my favorite being <em>2048</em>. I'm also passionate about cooking, as I find joy in creating and experimenting with different flavors and dishes.</p>

            <p>Beyond my personal interests, I also like to challenge myself through various activities. I used to be part of my schoolâ€™s swimming team and even participated in national competitions, which was a significant achievement in my life.</p>

            <p>If you'd like to follow along with my journey or get in touch, feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/definitely_nottinac" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>
